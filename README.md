# Bob Assistant
The new, fast and powerful AI that can code for u and run the code. The only problem is that you need to have an OpenAI API key, which might cost some money, but for sure you will find money for that (its incredibly cheap)!
The person that's writing this, HAHOOS aka Cheese, has no knowledge of Python but just wants to be in the Contributors

If you experience any issues with the code, make sure to post the issue so our nice developer Wojtmic can fix it (hes keeping me in a basement (no im not))

Wish you happy time talking with Bob, he's not very social to be honest.

And the team behind it:
- Wojtmic: Im programing this, lead developer and stuff.
- Tymon3310: He made the website and uh, testing, i guess.
- HAHOOS (aka cheese): The readme, and more testing, i guess.
